## appearently the main reason why this is set to no by default is that at some time
## this caused text to appear in the hosts language on other clients,
## see also https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth/issues/1420 . As the new
## version stores most of these strings as lua code this should no longer
## be the case for most of the strings.

## set WC_II_CONFIG_TRANSLATED "yes" will produce weird behavior in multiplayer server, as translations are saved only in host language settings. Languages without translations, will still enjoy mainline strings translated. This option is recomended for games with just 1 player or all players sharing language.

## having the file WC_II_CONFIG_ALLOW_ALIEN_ERAS at add-ons will allow play campaign with eras not suited for it, loading missing data from WC II era. Balance will be probably horrible and weird behaviors could happen. It is up to user take risk and addon won't be responsable of it.

## set WC_II_CONFIG_EMPIRE_AS_RANDOM "yes" will add The Empire to faction pool when selecting Random. It has no drawbacks, but it is considered a slighty unbalanced (weak) faction. It is a provisional faction waiting for Khalifate units being redefined and/or I invest more time testing them.
