This file describes how to make your addon work well together with
world conquest 2. In particular how to write an era that can be used together with world conquest ii.


Making an era that works well together with world conquest ii, is quite
easy: just add the [world_conquest_data] tag to your [multiplayer_side] tag just as
the standard word conquest2 era does, important: your era may not have
require_download=no for this to work. Furthermore if your era contains
new unit types that are not mainline wesnoth, don't forget to put an additional
[world_conquest_data] in [era] to describe which trails these unit types should get
when they are selected as heroes (use this to compensate weaker unit types).

To make an era/modification that also changes the enemy army unit types,
make sure to define the wc2_init_enemy event and use it to set the enemy_army
variable that should contains the pool of 'armies' that the enemies are chosen from:
```
[event]
	name = "wc2_init_enemy"
	[filter_conditional]
		[variable]
			name="wc2_enemy_army.length"
			equals=0
		[/variable]
	[/filter_conditional]
	[set_variables]
		name = "wc2_enemy_army"
		[literal]
			[group]
				id = "enemyfaction_id"
				recruit= "Orcish Grunt,Orcish Archer,Wolf Rider,Orcish Assassin,Troll Whelp"
				[recall]
					level2 = "Orcish Ruler, Orcish Slayer,..."
					level2 = "Orcish Warlord, Troll Warrior,..."
				[/recall]
				[commander]
					level1 = "Orcish Leader, Orcish Grunt,..."
					level2 = "Orcish Ruler, Orcish Slayer,..."
					level2 = "Orcish Warlord, Troll Warrior,..."
				[/commander]
				[leader]
					level2 = "Troll"
					level3 = "Troll Warrior"
					recruit = "Orcish Grunt,Orcish Archer,Troll Whelp"
				[/leader]
				[leader]
					level2 = "Orcish Warrior"
					level3 = "Orcish Warlord"
					recruit = "Orcish Grunt,Orcish Archer,Wolf Rider,Orcish Assassin"
				[/leader]
				....
			[/group]
		[/literal]
	[/set_variables]
[/event]
```
